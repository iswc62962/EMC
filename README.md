- scripts CLASSNAME\_edo\_index2r.py compute this detection
- results are in files CLASSNAME/edo_CLASSNAME_index2.r.m

# Ratios (table 2, figure 3, table 3)


# Use case: Near Identity Relationship (table 4)
- Corpora construction, pattern detection and results obtained are 
provides in the document supplemental/pattern/pattern.pdf

# Use case: Sparql Queries
